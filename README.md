# OXYGEN TOOL ⚡️

Welcome to **OXYGEN TOOL**! This tool is designed to provide various networking utilities like IP lookup, port scanning, pinging an IP, and sending messages to Discord via webhooks.

## Features 🚀

### 2. **Webhook Sender** 💬
Send custom messages to a Discord channel via a webhook. You can specify:
